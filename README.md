# Usage Examples

> All the examples shown below were performed using the extension's default settings. In your project feel free to
> customize as you wish.

## ✨ Flutter Tools Pro now read your pubspec.yaml file!

Since the Flutter Tools Pro extension has many features, in order to prevent the context menu from becoming cluttered
with items that won't be used in your projects, the Flutter Tools Pro extension now reads the pubspec.yaml file and,
based on the installed packages, enables or disables context menu items.

Among the supported packages, we have: **GetX**, **Riverpod**, **Flutter Modular**, and **MobX**.

So, let's begin the demonstration of using the extension, first without any of these packages installed, and then we'll
see the role of each one.

## Widgets

### Create Stateless Widget as Component:

![Usage](images/create-stateless-widget-component.gif)

### Create Stateless Widget as Page:

![Usage](images/create-stateless-widget-page.gif)

### Create Stateful Widget as Component:

![Usage](images/create-stateful-widget-component.gif)

### Create Stateful Widget as Page:

![Usage](images/create-stateful-widget-page.gif )

### Settings for Creating Pages with Widgets

#### Create folder for Widgets Pages

![Usage](images/settings-create-folder-for-widgets-page.gif)

#### Suffix for Widgets as Pages (Page, Screen or View)

![Usage](images/settings-create-folder-for-widgets-suffix.gif)

To create a Stateless Widget, right-click on the folder where the widget will be created, choose
`🔶 Create Stateless Widget` and inform the name of the widget that will be created.

![Usage](images/create-stateless-widget.gif)

## Create Stateful Widget Example:

To create a Stateful Widget, right-click on the folder where the widget will be created, choose
`🔷 Create Stateful Widget` and inform the name of the widget that will be created.

![Usage](images/create-stateful-widget.gif)

# GetX

## Create GetX App Structure Example:

> You need to have the `get` package installed in your `pubspec.yaml`

To create a GetX App Structure, right-click on the `lib` folder and choose `📂 Create GetX App Structure`.

![Usage](images/create-getx-app-structure.gif)

The folders that will be created by the command `📂 Create GetX App Structure`:

![Usage](images/getx-app-structure.png)

If you not will use some folder, just delete it from your project.

## Create GetX Feature Example:

> You need to have the `get` package installed in your `pubspec.yaml`

To create a GetX resource that is composed of the `view`, `controller`, `binding` and `route` files, right-click on the
`modules` folder or any subfolder inside it and choose `📑 Create GetX Feature`.

![Usage](images/create-getx-feature.gif)

You can create a folder to group GetX resources. In this case the name of the route file will be the name of the folder
created, as we can see in the example below:

![Usage](images/create-getx-feature-folder-group.gif)

## Create GetX Service Example:

> You need to have the `get` package installed in your `pubspec.yaml`

To create a GetX Service, right-click on the desired folder and choose  `🗃️ Create GetX Service`.

![Usage](images/create-getx-service.gif)

# MobX

## Create MobX Store

> You need to have the `mobx and flutter_mobx` package installed in your `pubspec.yaml`

To create a MobX Store, right-click on the desired folder and choose `📦 Create MobX Store`.

![Usage](images/create-mobx-store.gif)

# Interface for Providers, Repositories and Services

## Create Provider Interface Example:

Select the folder where the Provider Interface will be created and choose `📄 Create Provider Interface` and enter the
name of the provider interface to be created.

![Usage](images/create-providers.gif)

## Create Repository Interface Example:

Select the folder where the Repository Interface will be created and choose `📄 Create Repository Interface` and enter
the name of the repository interface to be created.

![Usage](images/create-repositories.gif)

## Create Service Interface Example:

Select the folder where the Service Interface will be created and choose `📄 Create Service Interface` and enter the name
of the service interface to be created.

![Usage](images/create-services.gif)

# Classes

## Create Class Example:

Select the folder where the class will be created and choose `📝 Create Dart Class` and enter the name of the class to be
created.

![Usage](images/create-class.gif)

## Create Controller Example:

Select the folder where the controller will be created and choose `📝 Create Controller` and enter the name of the
controller to be created.

![Usage](images/create-controller.gif)

## Create DTO Example:

Select the folder where the DTO will be created and choose `📝 Create DTO` and enter the name of the DTO to be created.

![Usage](images/create-dto.gif)

## Create Interface Example:

Select the folder where the interface will be created and choose `📝 Create Interface` and enter the name of the
interface to be created.

![Usage](images/create-interface.gif)

## Create Model Example:

Select the folder where the model will be created and choose `📝 Create Model` and enter the name of the model to be
created.

![Usage](images/create-model.gif)

## Create Singleton Class Example:

Select the folder where the model will be created and choose `📝 Create Singleton Class` and enter the name of the
singleton class to be created.

![Usage](images/create-singleton-class.gif)

# Code Actions

## Code action Implements Interface:

In interfaces files it is possible to use the code action `Implements interface` to create interface implementation file
case it is not implemented yet or when already exists and you want create another implementation of interface.

![Usage](images/implements-interface.gif)

# Extra wrappers

Use the code actions of Visual Studio Code to wrap a widget with one of the following wrappers:

- `Wrap with LayoutBuilder`
- `Wrap with Expanded`
- `Wrap with Stack`
- `Wrap with Positioned`
- `Wrap with Align`
- `Wrap with ClipRRect`
- `Wrap with Hero`
- `Wrap with GestureDetector`
- `Wrap with SingleChildScrollView`
- `Wrap with SafeArea`
- `Wrap with Form`
- `Wrap with Obx`
- `Wrap with Observer`

## Wrap with LayoutBuilder

![Usage](images/wrap-with-layout-builder.gif)

## Wrap with Expanded

![Usage](images/wrap-with-expanded.gif)

## Wrap with Stack

![Usage](images/wrap-with-stack.gif)

## Wrap with Positioned

![Usage](images/wrap-with-positioned.gif)

## Wrap with Align

![Usage](images/wrap-with-align.gif)

## Wrap with ClipRRect

![Usage](images/wrap-with-clip-rrect.gif)

## Wrap with Hero

![Usage](images/wrap-with-hero.gif)

## Wrap with GestureDetector

![Usage](images/wrap-with-gesture-detector.gif)

## Wrap with SingleChildScrollView

![Usage](images/wrap-with-single-child-scroll-view.gif)

## Wrap with SafeArea

![Usage](images/wrap-with-safe-area.gif)

## Wrap with Form

![Usage](images/wrap-with-form.gif)

## Wrap with Obx

In case of use of `GetX`, it is possible to wrapper a widget that uses an observable property with the widget `Obx` from
lib [`get`](https://pub.dev/packages/get).

![Usage](images/wrap-with-obx.gif)

## Wrap with Observer

In case of use of `MobX`, it is possible to wrapper a widget that uses an observable property with the widget `Observer`
from lib [`flutter_mobx`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_mobx).

![Usage](images/wrap-with-observer.gif)

## If wrap fails and breaks the code?

In some widgets structures by positioning the cursor over the widget which will be surrounded by new widget may cause
breaking the code.

![Usage](images/wrap-with-break-code.gif)

In this case, undo the last operation and select all the widget that will be wrapped using the shortcut `Alt` + `W`,
then use Visual Studio Code `code actions` and choose the appropriate wrapper.

![Usage](images/wrap-with-selecting.gif)
